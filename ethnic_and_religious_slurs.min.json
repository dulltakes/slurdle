Another thing that I've been seeing is, I guess they have a new slur for us. Uh, 'Pajeets'?  RUMNEEK JOHAL: Yeah. 'Jeet' or 'Pajeet.' Um. This, this kind of originated to make fun of Indian names -- which often have suffixes, '-jeet' being one of them -- but it then became, like, this trope of a quintessential Indian man. And again, like you said, some of these AI images or memes paint, paint them as very sinister, very scary looking, very unclean, very dirty. Often I've seen, even on social media, of saying the 'Jeets' or the 'Pajeets' need to go home. Or in, in a more horrible scenario I've seen even, you know, a news article be posted where a South Asian or Sikh man has died in a car crash or something.

Nowadays it is generally felt that the term carries a stigma\".[51] In 1994, the Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East marked the resolution of a dispute between those two Churches that had existed since the Council of Ephesus. They expressed their common understanding of doctrine concerning the divinity and humanity of Christ, and recognized the legitimacy and rightness of their respective descriptions of Mary as, on the Assyrian side, \"the Mother of Christ our God and Saviour\", and, on the Catholic side, as \"the Mother of God\" and also as \"the Mother of Christ\".[52]","References":["<cite class=\"citation journal cs1\" id=\"CITEREFBrock1996\">Brock, Sebastian P.
