Nowadays it is generally felt that the term carries a stigma\".[51] In 1994, the Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East marked the resolution of a dispute between those two Churches that had existed since the Council of Ephesus. They expressed their common understanding of doctrine concerning the divinity and humanity of Christ, and recognized the legitimacy and rightness of their respective descriptions of Mary as, on the Assyrian side, \"the Mother of Christ our God and Saviour\", and, on the Catholic side, as \"the Mother of God\" and also as \"the Mother of Christ\".[52]","references":["<cite class=\"citation journal cs1\" id=\"CITEREFBrock1996\">Brock, Sebastian P.
